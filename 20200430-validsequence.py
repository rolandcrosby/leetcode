# Check If a String Is a Valid Sequence from Root to Leaves Path in a Binary Tree
# Given a binary tree where each path going from the root to any leaf form a valid sequence, check if a given string is a valid sequence in such binary tree.
#
# We get the given string from the concatenation of an array of integers arr and the concatenation of all values of the nodes along a path results in a sequence in the given binary tree.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: root = [0,1,0,0,1,0,null,null,1,0,0], arr = [0,1,0,1]
# Output: true
# Explanation:
# The path 0 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1 is a valid sequence (green color in the figure).
# Other valid sequences are:
# 0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0
# 0 -> 0 -> 0
#
# Example 2:
# Input: root = [0,1,0,0,1,0,null,null,1,0,0], arr = [0,0,1]
# Output: false
# Explanation: The path 0 -> 0 -> 1 does not exist, therefore it is not even a sequence.
#
# Example 3:
# Input: root = [0,1,0,0,1,0,null,null,1,0,0], arr = [0,1,1]
# Output: false
# Explanation: The path 0 -> 1 -> 1 is a sequence, but it is not a valid sequence.
#
# Constraints:
# - 1 <= arr.length <= 5000
# - 0 <= arr[i] <= 9
# - Each node's value is between [0 - 9].
