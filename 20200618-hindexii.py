# H-Index II
# Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative
# integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
#
# According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of
# his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no
# more than h citations each."
#
# Example:
# Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them
# had received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers
# with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations
# each, her h-index is 3.
# Note:
#
# If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
#
# Follow up:
#
# This is a follow up problem to H-Index, where citations is now guaranteed to be sorted
# in ascending order.
# Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?
