# Flood Fill
# An image is represented by a 2-D array of integers, each integer representing the pixel value of the image (from 0 to 65535).
#
# Given a coordinate (sr, sc) representing the starting pixel (row and column) of the flood fill, and a pixel value newColor, "flood fill" the image.
#
# To perform a "flood fill", consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also with the same color as the starting pixel), and so on. Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with the newColor.
#
# At the end, return the modified image.
#
# Example 1:
# Input:
# image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]]
# sr = 1, sc = 1, newColor = 2
# Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]
# Explanation:
# From the center of the image (with position (sr, sc) = (1, 1)), all pixels connected
# by a path of the same color as the starting pixel are colored with the new color.
# Note the bottom corner is not colored 2, because it is not 4-directionally connected
# to the starting pixel.
#
# Note:
# - The length of image and image[0] will be in the range [1, 50].
# - The given starting pixel will satisfy 0 <= sr < image.length and 0 <= sc < image[0].length.
# - The value of each color in image[i][j] and newColor will be an integer in [0, 65535].
