# First Bad Version
# You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.
#
# Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.
#
# You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.
#
# Example:
#
# Given n = 5, and version = 4 is the first bad version.
#
# call isBadVersion(3) -> false
# call isBadVersion(5) -> true
# call isBadVersion(4) -> true
#
# Then 4 is the first bad version.

# The isBadVersion API is already defined for you.
# @param version, an integer
# @return a bool
# def isBadVersion(version):
